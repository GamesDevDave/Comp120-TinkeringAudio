## Contract #1 - Sound Effect Generation (Diegetic Audio)
Author - [James Heath](https://github.com/Heathage)

### Brief Expectations
1. Create a tool which will generate sound effects.
      - Consisting of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations.
2. The sound effects should clearly define player actions, such as;
      - Picking up an item
      - Attacking
      - Walking over traps
      - As well as other player actions found in games.
3. Tone variations are expected by method of procedual generation.

## Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio)

### Requirements of the brief:-
1. Create sounds to be used on a user interface.
      - This includes sounds such as button clicks, hovering over buttons etc.
2. The sounds must be generated by code.
      - Repurpose the algorithms used in the presentations.
3. Make the sounds configurable by designers.
